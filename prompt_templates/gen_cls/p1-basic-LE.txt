Fallacy Inventory:

Logical Form 1: Claim X is made. Y is concluded based on an ambiguous understanding of X.
Example 1: It is said that we have a good understanding of our universe.  Therefore, we know exactly how it began and exactly when.
Logical Form 2: Term X is used to mean Y in the premise. Term X is used to mean Z in the conclusion.
Example 2: A feather is light. What is light cannot be dark. Therefore, a feather cannot be dark.

Impossible Expectations:
Logical Form 1: X is what we have. Y is the perfect situation. Therefore, X is not good enough.
Example 1: Seat belts are a bad idea. People are still going to die in car crashes.

False Equivalence:
Logical Form 1: X and Y both share characteristic A. Therefore, X and Y are [behave] equal.
Example 1: They are both Felidae, mammals in the order Carnivora, therefore there's little difference between having a pet cat and a pet jaguar.

False Dilemma:
Logical Form 1: Either X or Y is true.
Example 1: I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t at church today.
Logical Form 2: P or Q could be true. P is true. Therefore, Q is not true.
Example 2: Bill is 6’11” tall, thin, but muscular.  We know he either is a pro basketball player or a jockey.  We conclude that it is more probable that he is a pro basketball player than a pro basketball player or a jockey.

Biased Sample Fallacy:
Logical Form 1: Sample S, which is biased, is taken from population P. Conclusion C is drawn about population P based on S.
Example 1: Based on a survey of 1000 American homeowners, 99% of those surveyed have two or more automobiles worth on average $100,000 each.  Therefore, Americans are very wealthy.

Hasty Generalization:
Logical Form 1: Sample S is taken from population P. Sample S is a very small part of population P. Conclusion C is drawn from sample S and applied to population P.
Example 1: My father smoked four packs of cigarettes a day since age fourteen and lived until age sixty-nine.  Therefore, smoking really can’t be that bad for you.

Causal Oversimplification:
Logical Form 1: A is regularly associated with B; therefore, A causes B.
Example 1: Every time I go to sleep, the sun goes down.  Therefore, my going to sleep causes the sun to set.
Logical Form 2: X is a contributing factor to Y. X and Y are present. Therefore, to remove Y, remove X.
Example 2: Smoking has been empirically proven to cause lung cancer. Therefore, if we eradicate smoking, we will eradicate lung cancer.

Fallacy of Composition:
Logical Form 1: A is part of B. A has property X. Therefore, B has property X.
Example 1: Hydrogen is not wet.  Oxygen is not wet.  Therefore, water (H2O) is not wet.
Logical Form 2:  A is part of B. B has property X. Therefore, A has property X.
Example 2:  His house is about half the size of most houses in the neighborhood. Therefore, his doors must all be about 3 1/2 feet high.

Fallacy of Exclusion:
Logical Form 2: Evidence A and evidence B is available. Evidence A supports the claim of person 1. Evidence B supports the counterclaim of person 2. Therefore, person 1 presents only evidence A.
Example 2: Hydrogen is not wet.  Oxygen is not wet.  Therefore, water (H2O) is not wet.
Logical Form 3: Evidence A and evidence B is available. Evidence A supports the claim of person 1. Evidence B supports the counterclaim of person 2. Therefore, evidence B is irrelevant to the claim.
Example 3:  His house is about half the size of most houses in the neighborhood. Therefore, his doors must all be about 3 1/2 feet high.

Task:
Examine the following fallacious argument:

Premise 1: "@@p0@@"
Premise 2: "@@context@@"
Premise 3: ""
Therefore: "@@claim@@"


Premises 1 and 2 are sourced from the same credible scientific document.
The claim is based on the information in Premise 1.
However, Premise 2 suggests that the claim is an invalid conclusion from the scientific document.

Your task is to identify and verbalize the fallacious reasoning in Premise 3 (the fallacious premise) that is necessary to support the claim, despite the conflicting information in Premise 2.
Only consider fallacies from the provided fallacy inventory.

Present each fallacious premise along with the applied fallacy class in this format:

    Fallacious Premise: <fallacious premise>; Applied Fallacy Class: <applied fallacy class>.

If there are multiple applicable fallacies, list them in order of relevance.
