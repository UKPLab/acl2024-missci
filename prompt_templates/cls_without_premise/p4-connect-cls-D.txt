Fallacy Inventory:

Ambiguity:
Definition 1: When an unclear phrase with multiple definitions is used within the argument; therefore, does not support the conclusion.
Definition 2: When the same word (here used also for phrase) is used with two different meanings.

Impossible Expectations:
Definition 1: Comparing a realistic solution with an idealized one, and discounting or even dismissing the realistic solution as a result of comparing to a “perfect world” or impossible standard, ignoring the fact that improvements are often good enough reason.

False Equivalence:
Definition 1: Assumes that two subjects that share a single trait are equivalent.

False Dilemma:
Definition 1: Presents only two alternatives, while there may be another alternative, another way of framing the situation, or both options may be simultaneously viable.
Definition 2: Making the false assumption that when presented with an either/or possibility, that if one of the options is true that the other one must be false.

Biased Sample Fallacy:
Definition 1: Drawing a conclusion about a population based on a sample that is biased, or chosen in order to make it appear the population on average is different than it actually is.

Hasty Generalization:
Definition 1: Drawing a conclusion based on a small sample size, rather than looking at statistics that are much more in line with the typical or average situation.

Causal Oversimplification:
Definition 1: Post hoc ergo propter hoc - after this therefore because of this. Automatically attributes causality to a sequence or conjunction of events.
Definition 2: Assumes there is a single, simple cause of an outcome.

Fallacy of Composition:
Definition 1: Inferring that something is true of the whole from the fact that it is true of some part of the whole.
Definition 2: Inferring that something is true of one or more of the parts from the fact that it is true of the whole.

Fallacy of Exclusion:
Definition 1: When only select evidence is presented in order to persuade the audience to accept a position, and evidence that would go against the position is withheld.
Definition 2: Ignores relevant and significant evidence when inferring to a conclusion.
Definition 3: Discarding the relevance of Premise 2 within the argument.

Task:
Examine the following fallacious argument:

Premise 1: "@@p0@@"
Premise 2: "@@context@@"
Premise 3: ""
Therefore: "@@claim@@"


Premises 1 and 2 are sourced from the same credible scientific document.
The claim is based on the information in Premise 1.
However, Premise 2 suggests that the claim is an invalid conclusion from the scientific document.

A fallacy must be applied when connecting Premise 1 and Premise 2 to robustly support the claim.
Your task is to identify the applied fallacy class. Only consider fallacies from the provided fallacy inventory.

Present each applied fallacy class in this format:

    Fallacy: <applied fallacy class>.

If there are multiple applicable fallacies, list them in order of relevance.
