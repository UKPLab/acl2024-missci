Given the following argument and definitions, determine which of the fallacies defined below occurs in Premise 3 of the provided argument.
The argument may contain multiple fallacies. Only detect the most fitting fallacy within Premise 3.
Explain your decision and conclude with the applied fallacy in a separate line at the end as "Fallacy: <fallacy class>".

Fallacies:

Ambiguity:
Definition 1: When an unclear phrase with multiple definitions is used within the argument; therefore, does not support the conclusion.
Definition 2: When the same word (here used also for phrase) is used with two different meanings.

Impossible Expectations:
Definition 1: Comparing a realistic solution with an idealized one, and discounting or even dismissing the realistic solution as a result of comparing to a “perfect world” or impossible standard, ignoring the fact that improvements are often good enough reason.

False Equivalence:
Definition 1: Assumes that two subjects that share a single trait are equivalent.

False Dilemma:
Definition 1: Presents only two alternatives, while there may be another alternative, another way of framing the situation, or both options may be simultaneously viable.
Definition 2: Making the false assumption that when presented with an either/or possibility, that if one of the options is true that the other one must be false.

Biased Sample Fallacy:
Definition 1: Drawing a conclusion about a population based on a sample that is biased, or chosen in order to make it appear the population on average is different than it actually is.

Hasty Generalization:
Definition 1: Drawing a conclusion based on a small sample size, rather than looking at statistics that are much more in line with the typical or average situation.

Causal Oversimplification:
Definition 1: Post hoc ergo propter hoc - after this therefore because of this. Automatically attributes causality to a sequence or conjunction of events.
Definition 2: Assumes there is a single, simple cause of an outcome.

Fallacy of Composition:
Definition 1: Inferring that something is true of the whole from the fact that it is true of some part of the whole.
Definition 2: Inferring that something is true of one or more of the parts from the fact that it is true of the whole.

Fallacy of Exclusion:
Definition 1: When only select evidence is presented in order to persuade the audience to accept a position, and evidence that would go against the position is withheld.
Definition 2: Ignores relevant and significant evidence when inferring to a conclusion.
Definition 3: Discarding the relevance of Premise 2 within the argument.

Argument:
Premise 1: "@@p0@@"
Premise 2: "@@context@@"
Premise 3: "@@fallacious_premise@@"
Therefore: "@@claim@@"
